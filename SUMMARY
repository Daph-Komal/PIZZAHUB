Pizzahub Sales Analysis Project Summary
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data to uncover key insights and drive business decisions. 
The analysis focused on understanding sales performance, customer preferences, and trends across various product categories, 
such as pizza types, toppings, and size preferences.

Key findings include:

Top-Selling Items: Identification of the most popular pizzas and toppings.
Sales Trends: Insights into peak sales periods (days, times, revenue).
Customer Behavior: Patterns in repeat purchases and preferences.
Revenue Insights: Contribution of different product categories to overall revenue.
Tools used for the analysis include  SQL (for data extraction and query optimization). 
The outcomes of this analysis can help optimize inventory, 
refine marketing strategies, and enhance customer satisfaction.
